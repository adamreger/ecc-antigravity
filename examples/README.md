# Note on Examples

> **⚠️ WARNING: Claude Code Specific**

The files in this directory (`CLAUDE.md`, `user-CLAUDE.md`, etc.) are example configurations originally written for **Claude Code**. 

They have **NOT** yet been ported or verified for use with **Antigravity IDE**. 

They are being kept here temporarily as a reference point for future adaptation into Antigravity `AGENTS.md` templates or `.agent/rules/` examples. **Do not use these files directly in an Antigravity project as they contain Claude Code-specific settings, paths, and commands that will not work.**
